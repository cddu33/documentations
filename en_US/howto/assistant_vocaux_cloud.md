> **Important**
>
> Google and AMAZON require that your Jeedom be accessible in HTTPS (the plugin does not work in HTTP) with a valid certificate (therefore no self-signed certificate)
>
> Thanks to the Power or Ultimate Service Packs, your Jeedom is accessible via HTTPS.
> If you have a Community Service Pack, you must install yourself an SSL certificate issued by a certification authority (ex: Let's encrypt, ...).

> **Important**
>
>Please note, due to a constraint from our service provider (OVH), the service only works in ipv4, so it is not ipv6 compatible
