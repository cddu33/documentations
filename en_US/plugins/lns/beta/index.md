# Plugin-template

This "plugin template" serves as a basis for creating plugins for **Jeedom**.

General plugin design documentation is available [here](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/).

In details :   
* [Using the plugin template](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/plugin_template) : The plugin template is a plugin base for Jeedom which must be adapted with the id of your plugin and to which you just have to add your own functions.

* [Info.json file](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/structure_info_json) : Integrated since version 3.0 from Jeedom, the file **info.json** is mandatory for the proper functioning of the plugins and their proper deployment on the Jeedom Market.

* [Plug-in icon](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/Icone_de_plugin) : In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, any plugin must have an icon. Be careful not to use the same color code as the icons of official Jeedom plugins.

* [Plugin Widget](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/widget_plugin) : Presentation of the different ways to include custom widgets to the plugin.

* [Plugin Documentation](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/documentation_plugin) : Overview of setting up documentation because a good plugin is nothing without proper documentation.

* [Publish plugin](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/publication_plugin) : Description of the prerequisites essential to the publication of the plugin.
