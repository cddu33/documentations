- Possibility of adding a hold delay for a trigger before triggering the alarm

# 12/01/2017

-   Correction of a bug on deactivation of detectors

-   Management of seconds on the activation delay (JEED-63)

-   Backtracking on the non-initiation of immediate actions if
    the activation delay is empty or zero

-   If during activation a sensor is on alert and has no delay
    of activation then the alarm is armed nevertheless by ignoring this sensor
    (unless he comes back to rest)

-   Addition of global trigger action (no longer filtered by zone, it
    is recommended to use this rather than the actions of
    zone trigger)

-   Code optimization

-   Be careful : the alarm no longer performs immediate actions if there is no
    trigger delay !!!!!! â‡’ Canceled

-   Ability to filter the actions in relation to
    alarm mode

-   Add pause / resume command

-   Improvement of the configuration interface
