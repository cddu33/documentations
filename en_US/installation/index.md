# Equipment

Jeedom can be installed on different hardware components :

-   a Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4 
-   Synology NAS
-   any Linux system based on Debian 10 (Buster)
-   Freebox Delta

You can also buy a ready-made box with Jeedom preinstalled which also contains a service pack (more support and services) and plugins offered :

- [Jeedom Atlas Z-Wave +](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/box-domotique/5847-jeedom-controleur-domotique-jeedom-atlas-z-wave.html)
- [Jeedom Atlas Zigbee](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/box-domotique/5878-jeedom-controleur-domotique-jeedom-atlas-zigbee.html)
- [Jeedom Atlas EnOcean](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/box-domotique/5877-jeedom-controleur-domotique-jeedom-atlas-enocean.html)

In DIY editing (Do It Yourself), here is a "typical" configuration to get started with Jeedom in Z-Wave :

1. Raspberry pi 4 :

-   A raspberry + box 50 €
-   An Aeotec Gen 5 key \ ~ € 60
-   A microSD micro card \ ~ € 7
-   A USB power supply € 8

A total of € 125 for an open source home automation box with complete control over its installation.

> **Tip**
>
> - It is possible to add or change with an Rfxcom antenna, or an enOcean key, etc. 
> - In principle, you need a USB key per additional protocol. Depending on their number and their cumulative consumption, on a Raspberry Pi you may need an additional USB hub with its dedicated power supply. 
> - For the Z-Wave Aeotec Gen 5 key in cumulative use with a Raspberry Pi 4 (previous models not affected), you must use a recent one if you want to do away with a USB hub. Get information and get supplies from a home automation equipment seller.
> - On RPi 4, it is strongly recommended to replace the microSD card with an mSATA USB3 hard disk, directly connected to the USB3 port with native boot. MicroSD cards have a very limited lifespan due to intensive data exchange: only to be reserved for short periods of testing.

> **Tip**
>
> Jeedom is software that is and will remain open source, its use is completely free and does not depend on a cloud or a subscription. However, some plugins that increase the capacity of Jeedom or its use may be chargeable **and may need an internet connection**. You can find the list of plugins [here](http://market.jeedom.fr/index.php?v=d&p=market&type=plugin).

> Service pack ? What is it ? You can see [here](https://blog.jeedom.com/?p=1215) the advantages of service packs.
